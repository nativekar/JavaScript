<h2> <a href="https://github.com/nativekar">nativeKar</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Vaibhav80">Vaibhav80 </a>'s collabrative effort in solving frequently asked coding questions using JavaScript. </h2>

<p> Each problem will be saved in file of its own. Everytime a new file is added, readme is to be updated. </p>

<ul>

<li>
wordCount - Given an input string of 'K' and 'N', where K denotes a number and N the range, find the number of times K can be found in range N. Example, if "2 35" is the input, the algorithm should determine how many times the number 2 repeats within range 0-35.
</li>

<li>
zerosAndOnes - Given an array of 0s and 1s, sort all 0s to the left and all 1s to the right.
Example - zerosAndOnesArray = [0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0] => zerosAndOnesArray = [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]
</li>

<li>
zeroSumArray - Given a number N, return an array of N elements whose sum equals 0.
Example - N = 4 => array = [1,-1,2,-2]
</li>

<li>
linearSearch - Given an array and a number, find whether the number exists in the given array or not.
Example - arr = [10, 12, 14, 17], numberToFind = 14 => Number found at position 3.
</li>

<li>
binarySearch - Given an array and a number, find whether the number exists in the given array or not in O(log n) time.
Example - arr = [10, 12, 14, 17], numberToFind = 14 => Number found at position 3.
</li>

<li>
subArrayWithGivenSum - Given an array and a sum, find consecutives array elements which add up to the given sum.
Example - arr = [10, 12, 14, 17], sum = 36 => Sum found between positions 0 to 2.
</li>

<li>
findWordFromArray - Given a word and an array of words, find if the array elements can be so combined as to form the given word.
Example - word = "randomword" arr = ["random", "an", "the", "word"] => returns <I>true</I> as randomword can be formed.
</li>

<li>
arrayRotation - Given an array and a number, rotate the array along the number.
Example - arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6] d = 2 => rotatedArray = [3,4,5,6,1,2]
</li>

<li>
firstNonRecurringChar - Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in the string.
Example - S = 'aabbccdeefgg' => 'd'
</li>

<li>
maxiumContigousSumArray - Given an array, find the maximum sum of contigous elemets. 
Example - arr = [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3] => maximumSum = 7;
</li>

<li>
minimumSumPairInArray - Given an array, find the minimum sum of two elemets. 
Example - arr = [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3] => minimumSum = -6;
</li>
