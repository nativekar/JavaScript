<h2> <a href="https://github.com/nativekar">nativeKar</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Vaibhav80">Vaibhav80 </a>'s collabrative effort in solving frequently asked coding questions using JavaScript. </h2>

<p> Each problem will be saved in file of its own. Everytime a new file is added, readme is to be updated. </p>

<ul>

<li>
wordCount - Given an input string of 'K' and 'N', where K denotes a number and N the range, find the number of times K can be found in range N. Example, if "2 35" is the input, the algorithm should determine how many times the number 2 repeats within range 0-35.
</li>

<li>
zerosAndOnes - Given an array of 0s and 1s, sort all 0s to the left and all 1s to the right.
Example - zerosAndOnesArray = [0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0] => zerosAndOnesArray = [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]
</li>

<li>
zeroSumArray - Given a number N, return an array of N elements whose sum equals 0.
Example - N = 4 => array = [1,-1,2,-2]
</li>

<li>
linearSearch - Given an array and a number, find whether the number exists in the given array or not.
Example - arr = [10, 12, 14, 17], numberToFind = 14 => Number found at position 3.
</li>

<li>
binarySearch - Given an array and a number, find whether the number exists in the given array or not in O(log n) time.
Example - arr = [10, 12, 14, 17], numberToFind = 14 => Number found at position 3.
</li>

<li>
subArrayWithGivenSum - Given an array and a sum, find consecutives array elements which add up to the given sum.
Example - arr = [10, 12, 14, 17], sum = 36 => Sum found between positions 0 to 2.
</li>

<li>
findWordFromArray - Given a word and an array of words, find if the array elements can be so combined as to form the given word.
Example - word = "randomword" arr = ["random", "an", "the", "word"] => returns <I>true</I> as randomword can be formed.
</li>

<li>
arrayRotation - Given an array and a number, rotate the array along the number.
Example - arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6] d = 2 => rotatedArray = [3,4,5,6,1,2]
</li>

<li>
firstNonRecurringChar - Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in the string.
Example - S = 'aabbccdeefgg' => 'd'
</li>

<li>
maxiumContigousSumArray - Given an array, find the maximum sum of contiguous elements. 
Example - arr = [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3] => maximumSum = 7;
</li>

<li>
minimumSumPairInArray - Given an array, find the minimum sum of two elements. 
Example - arr = [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3] => minimumSum = -6;
</li>

<li>
firstBadVersion - You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one,
which causes all the following ones to be bad.
You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad.
Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

</li>

<li>
jewelsAndStones - You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
